## Section 1: Course Overview

## Section 2: Python Setup

### 1. Command Line basics

// See in which folder you are in  
`pwd`  
// Go to a new directory  
`cd Documents`  
// Move back in folders  
`cd`
// Create a folder  
`mkdir my-folder`  
// Delete file  
`rm -r test-file.txt`  
// Delete folder  
`rm -rf my-folder`

### 2. Installing Python (Step by Step)

Just search only for your OS proper Python installation
there are installers for Linux, Mac and Windows OS

// For linux Fedore, Example:  
https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-anaconda-on-fedora/  
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#open-nav-lin

// To launch Anaconda Navigator  
`anaconda-navigator`  
Then in Home, launch Jupyter notebook

// For FREE "No Install" Options:

- jupyter.org/try
- Google Collab Online Notebooks
- Repl.it
- Google Search: "Python Interpreter Online"

// Problems with FREE "No Install" Options

- Hard to upload your own code, data, or notebooks!
- May not save your code in the free version!
- Not officially part of this course or supported by this course!
